# Poster for Iceland Unlimited travel agency
I create a poster using basic HTML and CSS. It is very minimalistic poster, advertising Iceland as a travel destination. I practise some of CSS skills. I cenetered title and logo. I made logo white in CSS in order to not be more appealing and would fit design more. I got the final look by making in grayscale and then I added brightness. I animated a fog with keyframes so there is a movement in a page and it adds a bit of unusual touch.
